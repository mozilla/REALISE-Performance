                Welcome to AnnotateChange, an annotation app for change point 
                detection.

                Our goal with AnnotateChange is to create a dataset of 
                human-annotated time series to use in the development and 
                evaluation of change point algorithms.

                We really appreciate that you've agreed to help us with this! 
                Without your help this project would not be possible.

                In the next few pages, we'll introduce you to the problem of 
                change point detection. We'll look at a few datasets and see 
                different types of changes that can occur.

                Thanks again for your help!"""
